# AIGS_1014_Group_2_Driver_Drowsiness_Detection_System

This Repository contains Dataset, ipynb file which conatins the code and Testcase report for Driver Drowsiness Detection System.

# ----Datset----
Dataset consists of Original Data folder which consists of actual data meaning the data images for drowsy and awake state.
This dataset has now been divided into two folders which is "awake" and "drowsy", which has all the segregated data.
Dataset.csv file contains the image names correctly labelled to the respective state in order to train the model.

# ----ipynb file----
This file contains all the code and workaround for the driver dorwsiness system. 
Below is the list of sections that we have coded on.
1. using Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)
2. using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
3. nodding ans shaking detection
4. integration of EAR, MAR, and head nodding
5. model creation using Random Forest
6. Testing random forest model
7. neural network model creation and training
8. testing of model using neural network
9. testing of model based on neural network with nodding and shaking
10. neural network model creation including dropout layer and batch normalization
